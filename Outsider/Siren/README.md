## Summary
"If you die, Demons act twice the next time they act."

The Siren is a outsider-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The idea is the siren distracts everybody so the demon can act twice.

## How to run

When the Siren dies mark every demon with the '*2' reminder. The next time you wake a demon remove the mark and let them act twice.

## Examples

If player A is the Demon and player B the siren was executed, this night player A can act twice (usually they kills twice).

If player A is the Demon and player B the siren who died at night before the demon acted, player A will still act twice this night.

If player A is the Demon and player B the siren who dies at night after the demon acted or during the demon action, player A will act twice the following night.
