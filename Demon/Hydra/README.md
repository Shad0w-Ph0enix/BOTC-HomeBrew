**Summary**

The hydra is a demon-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The game starts with two hydras in play, however there are no minions in play.
If you don't kill both hydras on the same day (meaning one survives), in the next night, another hydra is created with the alive hydra learning who it is.
How are you supposed to kill two people a day? Well, the hydra also adds another nomination & execution round each day, starting after the first player has been executed.

**How to run**

*This character is very new, so there are still things to be tested*

**Examples**

Player A and Player B both are evil hydras. B manages to successfully bluff another role, while A is executed. At dusk of that day, this causes Player C to become an evil hydra. Player B learns that C turned into a hydra, whereas C does not know who his team is.

**How to fight the Hydra**

Info: as the character is very new, some new strategies might develop after playing. So these are just some tips for how we expect to play against the hydra based on its ability.

The demon punishes wrong executions as you loose "half" of your information when killing only one hydra. You need to find out who became the new one by things like people spreading false information or changes in the information the good team receives. Due to the negative effects of wrongful executions, it is recommended to wait until later in the game to execute, when the information density allows you to make a better guess at who is evil. This fits the hydra's ability as it can't kill towsnfolk very quickly without losing its potential poisoning effects on information-gathering roles.
