**Summary**

The hydra is a demon-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The game starts with two hydras in play, however there are no minions in play.
If you don't kill both hydras on the same day (meaning one survives), in the next night, another hydra is created with the alive hydra learning who it is.
How are you supposed to kill two people a day? Well, the hydra also adds another nomination & execution round each day, starting after the first player has been executed.

**How to run**

*This character is very new, so there are still things to be tested*

**Examples**

Player A and Player B both are evil hydras. B manages to successfully bluff another role, while A is executed. At dusk of that day, this causes Player C to become an evil hydra. Player B learns that C turned into a hydra, whereas C does not know who his team is.
