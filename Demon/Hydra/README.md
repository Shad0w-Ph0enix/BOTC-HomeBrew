## Summary
"Each night* choose a player (not yourself), they are poisoned until you choose again in the following night. If the same player is chosen twice by Hydras in the same night, the player is no longer poisoned, but dies. Everybody knows you are in play.  If there is only one hydra alive, at the start of the next night an alive player becomes an evil hydra. The alive hydra learns who. After the first execution, there is another nomination & execution round. Everybody regains their ability to nominate and be nominated. Execution fails, if only hydras voted. [+ 1 Hydra; No minions]"

The hydra is a demon-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The game starts with two hydras in play, however there are no minions in play.
If you don't kill both hydras on the same day (meaning one survives), in the next night, another hydra is created with the alive hydra learning who it is.
How are you supposed to kill two people a day? Well, the hydra also adds another nomination & execution round each day, starting after the first player has been executed.

## How to run

While preparing the first night, have 2 Hydras in game and no Minions.

During the first night, wake both Hydras in any particular order and tell both who the other Hydra is and the 3 demon bluffs you choose.

While preparing the other night, if only 1 Hydra is alive go to the alive Hydra and say who is the new evil Hydra. Go to the previously mentioned player and say to him, that he is now an evil Hydra.

During the other night, prior to waking both Hydras remove their POISONED mark. Then wake both Hydras in any particular order and ask them who they want to choose (except themself). Put the POISONED reminder on the choosen player or mark them with the DEAD reminder if already poisoned by another Hydra. If a Siren has the 'x2' reminder ask both Hydras two times. Remove the DEAD reminder token after you proclaimed the player dead at dawn.

## Examples

Player A and Player B both are evil hydras. B manages to successfully bluff another role, while A is executed. At dusk of that day, this causes Player C to become an evil hydra. Player B learns that C turned into a hydra, whereas C does not know who his team is.

## Tips and Tricks

## How to fight the Hydra

Info: as the character is very new, some new strategies might develop after playing. So these are just some tips for how we expect to play against the hydra based on its ability.

The demon punishes wrong executions as you loose "half" of your information when killing only one hydra. You need to find out who became the new one by things like people spreading false information or changes in the information the good team receives. Due to the negative effects of wrongful executions, it is recommended to wait until later in the game to execute, when the information density allows you to make a better guess at who is evil. This fits the hydra's ability as it can't kill towsnfolk very quickly without losing its potential poisoning effects on information-gathering roles.
